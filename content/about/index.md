I am a Software Architect with deep engineering roots based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, with over 18 years of experience designing and building scalable, high-performance systems. My work spans industries like banking, energy, insurance, and retail, where I have designed robust architectures, implemented complex backend systems, and solved large-scale engineering challenges. I specialize in .NET, cloud technologies (Azure, AWS), and enterprise software development.

I am passionate about software design and coding, always striving to create efficient, maintainable, and scalable solutions. I have a strong focus on software architecture, Clean Architecture principles, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Test-Driven Development (TDD) to build high-quality software. 

Currently, I'm exploring new technologies and methodologies to enhance software development practices. My goal is to expand my expertise by contributing to open-source projects and sharing my knowledge through writing and speaking.

Beyond the world of technology, I'm a proud family man and father. Outside of work hours, you can find me exploring new destinations through travel or enjoying wine tasting - always appreciating the craftsmanship and stories behind a good bottle, much like I do with well-designed solutions.

This site is my platform to share my journey, ideas, and projects as I continue growing in the field.
