"I am a Software Architect and Engineer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, with over 18 years of experience designing and building scalable, high-performance systems. My work spans industries like banking, energy, insurance, and retail, where I have designed robust architectures, implemented complex backend systems, and solved large-scale engineering challenges. I specialize in .NET, cloud technologies (Azure, AWS), and enterprise software development."

"I am passionate about software design and coding, always striving to create efficient, maintainable, and scalable solutions. I have a strong focus on software architecture, Clean Architecture principles, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Test-Driven Development (TDD) to build high-quality software. My goal is to expand my expertise by contributing to open-source projects and sharing my knowledge through writing and speaking. This site is my platform to share my journey, ideas, and projects as I continue growing in the field."
