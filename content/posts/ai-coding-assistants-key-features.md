# AI Coding Assistants: Key Features

AI-powered coding tools—such as [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) and [Cursor AI](https://www.cursor.ai/)— are revolutionizing the development workflow by offering intelligent assistance for writing, debugging, and optimizing code. In this article, we’ll explore the main features provided by these tools, using Golang examples to demonstrate their practical applications.

## 1. Code Autocompletion

### Description
AI-powered coding assistants can predict and suggest the next part of your code based on context. In Golang, this might mean auto-generating function bodies or completing expressions as you type.

### Sample
```go
// Example: Function to calculate the area of a circle in Golang
package main

import "fmt"

func CalculateArea(radius float64) float64 {
    return 3.14 * radius * radius
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(CalculateArea(5))
}
```

In this example, an AI assistant might suggest the complete function call or the function body when you begin typing CalculateArea( .


## 2. Contextual Code Suggestions

### Description
AI tools analyze your code context—variables, functions, and comments—to offer suggestions that fit your coding style and task.

### Sample
```go

// Task: Generate a function to calculate factorial
// The AI could suggest a complete implementation based on this comment

package main

import "fmt"

func Factorial(n int) int {
    if n == 0 {
        return 1
    }
    return n * Factorial(n-1)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Factorial(5))
}

```

Here, the assistant understands the comment and context, generating a recursive factorial function in Golang.
