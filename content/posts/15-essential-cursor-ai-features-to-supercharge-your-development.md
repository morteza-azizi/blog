### Description
Cursor's AI Tab feature predicts and suggests code as you type, offering context-aware completions ranging from simple expressions to entire function implementations. It learns from your coding style and adapts to your preferences, suggesting multi-line code snippets that maintain your programming patterns.

### Sample
```csharp
// Example: Creating a method to process user data in C#
public class UserService
{
    public async Task<User> ProcessUserData(string userId)
    {
        // Cursor might suggest this entire implementation
        var user = await _userRepository.GetByIdAsync(userId);
        if (user == null)
        {
            throw new UserNotFoundException($"User with ID {userId} not found.");
        }
        
        user.LastAccessDate = DateTime.UtcNow;
        await _userRepository.UpdateAsync(user);
        return user;
    }
}
```

The AI Tab suggests code based on your existing codebase, maintaining consistency with your programming style and patterns.

## 2. Cursor Chat

### Description
Cursor Chat provides a conversational interface where developers can ask coding-related questions, get explanations, or receive guidance directly within the editor. The chat understands your entire codebase, providing contextually relevant answers and code snippets.

### Use Cases
- **Code explanation**: "Explain how this dependency injection works in my service"
- **Problem solving**: "How can I optimize this LINQ query for performance?"
- **Debugging assistance**: "Why am I getting this NullReferenceException?"
- **Best practices**: "What's the most efficient way to implement this interface?"

Cursor Chat is accessible with a simple keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+L) and maintains context between conversations, making it a powerful tool for ongoing development assistance.

## 3. Multi-File Edits with Agent Mode

### Description
Cursor's Agent Mode enables AI-powered editing across multiple files, helping developers implement complex changes that span throughout their codebase. This feature is particularly valuable for refactoring or implementing new features that affect several parts of an application.

### Capabilities
- **Context awareness**: Understands relationships between different files in your project
- **Autonomous operation**: The AI can determine which files need changes, make those changes, and iterate until the task is complete
- **Terminal command execution**: Can run necessary terminal commands as part of the solution
- **Error remediation**: Automatically attempts to fix errors that arise during implementation

### Sample
```csharp
// Example: Adding a new feature that requires changes across multiple files
// In UserController.cs:
[HttpGet("profile")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetUserProfile()
{
    var user = await _userService.GetCurrentUserAsync();
    return Ok(_mapper.Map<UserProfileDto>(user));
}

// In UserService.cs:
public async Task<User> GetCurrentUserAsync()
{
    var userId = _currentUserProvider.GetUserId();
    return await _userRepository.GetByIdAsync(userId);
}

// In UserProfileDto.cs:
public class UserProfileDto
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string DisplayName { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public DateTime LastLogin { get; set; }
    public List<UserPreferenceDto> Preferences { get; set; }
}
```

With a single prompt like "Add a user profile endpoint with preferences," Cursor can generate and modify all these files appropriately.

## 4. Smart Rewrites

### Description
Cursor's Smart Rewrites feature helps refactor and improve existing code without changing its functionality. It can suggest cleaner, more maintainable implementations based on modern coding practices and patterns specific to your language.

### Sample
```csharp
// Before: A method with nested conditionals and repetitive code
public decimal CalculateDiscount(Order order)
{
    decimal discount = 0;
    if (order.TotalAmount > 1000)
    {
        if (order.Customer.IsVip)
        {
            discount = order.TotalAmount * 0.15m;
        }
        else
        {
            discount = order.TotalAmount * 0.10m;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        if (order.Customer.IsVip)
        {
            discount = order.TotalAmount * 0.10m;
        }
        else
        {
            discount = order.TotalAmount * 0.05m;
        }
    }
    return discount;
}

// After Cursor Smart Rewrite: Cleaner implementation with the same functionality
public decimal CalculateDiscount(Order order)
{
    var baseDiscount = order.TotalAmount > 1000 ? 0.10m : 0.05m;
    var vipBonus = order.Customer.IsVip ? 0.05m : 0;
    
    return order.TotalAmount * (baseDiscount + vipBonus);
}
```

This feature helps maintain code quality by suggesting improvements that make your code more readable and maintainable.

## 5. Natural Language to Code (NL2Code)

### Description
Cursor allows developers to write or modify code using natural language instructions. Simply describe what you want to achieve, and Cursor will generate the corresponding code in the appropriate language and style.

### Sample
```csharp
// Natural language prompt:
// "Create a C# method that connects to a SQL database using Entity Framework, 
// queries all active users, and returns them as a list"

// Cursor-generated C# code:
public async Task<List<User>> GetActiveUsersAsync()
{
    using (var context = new ApplicationDbContext())
    {
        return await context.Users
            .Where(u => u.IsActive)
            .OrderBy(u => u.LastName)
            .ToListAsync();
    }
}
```

This powerful feature bridges the gap between conceptual thinking and code implementation, allowing developers to describe their intent in plain language and get working code in return.

```csharp
// Original code with potential issues
public void ProcessUserInput(string userInput)
{
    using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
    {
        connection.Open();
        var command = new SqlCommand($"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '{userInput}'", connection);
        var reader = command.ExecuteReader();
        // Process results
    }
}

// AI Code Review feedback:
// 1. Security vulnerability: SQL Injection risk detected in line 5. 
//    Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation.
// 2. Resource leak: SqlDataReader not properly disposed.
// 3. Error handling: No exception handling for database operations.
// 4. Performance: Consider using async methods for database operations.

// Suggested improvement:
public async Task ProcessUserInputAsync(string userInput)
{
    try
    {
        using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        await using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
        {
            await connection.OpenAsync();
            
            var command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @Username", connection);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Username", userInput);
            
            await using var reader = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync();
            // Process results
        }
    }
    catch (SqlException ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Database error when processing user input");
        throw new DatabaseOperationException("Error processing user data", ex);
    }
}
```

This proactive review process helps catch issues early in the development cycle, reducing the time spent in formal code reviews and improving overall code quality.
