# Comparing GitHub Copilot vs Cursor AI: Performance Analysis

I'd like to compare these two popular AI coding tools using objective factors and real-world development scenarios. In this upcoming project, I'll systematically evaluate each tool across multiple dimensions, documenting my methodology, observations, and results.

My plan is to analyze each factor one by one, creating a GitHub repository that will contain all test code, measurement methods, and detailed findings. I'll record my interactions with both tools to provide transparent evidence for my conclusions, ensuring a fair and comprehensive comparison that will be valuable for developers trying to choose between these assistants.

This comparison will go beyond subjective opinions, focusing on measurable metrics and practical usage examples. Stay tuned as I build this resource for anyone interested in understanding the true capabilities and limitations of GitHub Copilot and Cursor AI.

## Measurement Approach

To ensure a fair and objective comparison, I'll employ several measurement techniques:

- **Response time**: Measured in milliseconds using time-tracking software
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of suggestions that compile without errors and perform the intended function
- **Code quality**: Using static analysis tools and established metrics (cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index)
- **Context awareness**: Scoring based on tool's ability to reference other code files or related functions
- **Creativity & Adaptability**: Evaluation of how well the tool handles novel or complex requirements

All tests will be conducted on the same hardware and software environment to eliminate variables that might affect performance. Each test will be repeated multiple times to ensure statistical significance and eliminate random factors.

## Performance Metrics to Evaluate

The table below outlines the key metrics I'll be measuring in my comparison. As testing has not yet been conducted, all values are marked as "Pending" and will be replaced with actual measurements once the evaluation is complete.
